# TinyGW

This is a highly reduced GCC+MinGW setup that's meant to pair with TinyCC.
All libraries/headers/objects/etc were manually selected via the optimized-compilation of a basic software-rendered Windows program.
The build process uses MSYS2 to get the latest versions of everything!

You can easily download it, uncompress with 7zip, and use it:
